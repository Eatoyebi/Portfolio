# Liz Atoyebi Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, built using ASP.NET Core and C#. It’s a multi-page web application designed to showcase my technical projects, leadership experience, and growth as a developer. Rather than using a static template, I'm building this site to reflect both my design thinking and backend development skills. The goal is to create a professional, fully functional web experience that feels personal and polished.

## Live Site  
Visit: https://eatoyebi.github.io/Portfolio

## Tech Stack  
• ASP.NET Core MVC (or Razor Pages or Blazor (haven't complely decided yet/may update in the future))
• C# for backend logic  
• HTML and CSS3 for structure and styling  
• JavaScript for optional enhancements  
• Hosted on Github

## Site Overview  
• Home  
• About Me  
• Projects  
• Contact

## Why I Built This  
I didn’t just want a portfolio that listed my experience, my resume does that well enough, I wanted one that showed it. This site is a way for me to practice what I’ve learned, experiment with new ideas, and create something that speaks for me before I even get in the room.

## Future Enhancements  
• Make it fully responsive for mobile and tablet  
• Add smooth page transitions or subtle animations  
• Integrate a small CMS or admin panel to manage updates  
• Build a blog section powered by Entity Framework Core and a database
