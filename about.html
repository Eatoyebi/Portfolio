      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m Liz Atoyebi, a double major in Software Application Development and Information Technology with a concentration in Data Technology. My goal is to become a software engineer who creates people-centered tools.</p>
      <p>I'm currently studying at the University of Cincinnati, where I’ve taken on internships, leadership roles, and hands-on projects that reflect not just what I know, but how I think. I’ve worked with tools that bring ideas to life, and I’m always looking to level up my skills.</p>
      <p>Outside of the classroom, I lead, organize, and create. Whether it’s chairing events, coordinating communication strategies, or mentoring others in tech spaces, I believe in showing up for my work, my community, and my future.</p>
